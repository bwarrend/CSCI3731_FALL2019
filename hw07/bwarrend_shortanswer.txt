Brett Warrender HW07 Short Answer


1. What does the friend keyword do?
	Normally, a function would not have access to a classes private members.  With the use of Friend, 
a function is given special access to the private and protected members of the class.


2. Why should you never use 'using namespace std;'?
	When using namespace std, you run the risk of name collisions between the std library and any
other library.  It is better to explicitly specify the namespace before using one of its methods/functions.

3. Why is memory management in C++ hard?
	Memory managment is hard because C++ is not your friend and does not care about you.  While creating
a program, it is our responsibility to ensure that everything on the heap gets deleted in a timely fashion. 
If not, it can cause memory leaks.  The hard part is just keeping track of what owns what and where things 
get deleted and making sure that they only get deleted once.

4. Describe the concept of "ownership", as it pertains to memory mangement in C++.
	Ownership is a way of keeping track of everything that is stored on the heap.  It needs to be 
deleted at some point or the program can leak.  It is necessary to dole out this responsibility so that 
heap data is deleted once and only once.

5. What are the three ways that a class can contain objects in C++?
	The three ways that a class can contain objects in C++ are actual objects, references, and pointers.

6. What is a forward declaration and why would you use one?
	A forward declaration is used when two different classes need to refer to each other.  You cannot 
simply include the headers because one of them will have already been defined as the compiler goes through 
the first class.  A forward declaration has limited use, pointers and references, but tells the compiler 
that there exists this other class that we are going to point to or reference.
