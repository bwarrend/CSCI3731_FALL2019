1. Libraries are useful for many reasons.  Chances are, someone has already done what I would like to do, or at least something similar.  Libraries are a really great way to be able to use that code and is often very simple to understand.  The user of the library doesn't even have to know what all of the code does or how it works, they only need to know that if they input x, the output is y.  Libraries can shrink a huge project down into a much smaller because the code is already written.  

2. The two types of libraries are static and shared shared object libraries.  Static libraries are just .o files and are only required during compilation. The libjpeg library we used for this week's coding homework is and example of a static library.   Using static libraries is like adding a bunch of lines of code to your project.  Shared object libraries, also called dynamic linked libraries, are still required at runtime and are separate from the executable.  These can be distruted with software and are often tucked away into system folders (at least for Windows).
