1. What is the rule of five?
	Old rule of 3.  If you do any of the following, you must do all of them:
	- Copy assignment operator using =
	- Copy Constructor
	- Move assignment operator using =
	- Move Constructor
	- Destructor

2. What is the difference between a copy and a move in C++?
	Copying is a way of making two of the same thing, but have them 
completely independent of one another.  Preserve the original thing.  Moves happen 
when original is just a temproray and the compiler cannot copy elide, or std::move 
is explicitly used.


3. What is copy elision?
	Copy elision is a compiler optimization where the compiler, under the correct 
 conditions, can skip extra steps when creating a copy of an object. The compiler is 
not required to do this, but can, sometimes.


4. What is a smart pointer?
	A class that pretends to be a pointer by overloading the * and -> operators 
generally used by pointers.  A smart pointer, contains an actual pointer, and can do 
its own garbage collection and keep track of ownership.


5.  How can you prevent someone from copying a class you wrote?
	Write an operator overload for = in the header file and set it to delete which 
which essentially disables the default copy method for the compiler.
