1. What is the difference between int and const int?
		An int is a variable that can declared, defined, and changed throughout the
	program.  A const int is a constant and once declared, cannot be changed
	again.

2. What is the difference between a function declaration and a function
definition?
		A function declaration is just stating that a function exists, what it
	requires as an input, and what it returns.  The definition of the function is
	where the code for the function is actually written.  A declaration and
	definition can be at the same time< but a declaration is required for the
	compiler to be able call the function at another time.

3. What is wrong with the following C++ code? How would you fix it?

int sum;
for (int i=0; i<1000; ++i)
{
	sum += i;
}

printf("Sum of 0 to 999 is %d\n", sum);


sum was never defined.  While this program should give the desired result most
of the time, sometimes sum will not start at 0;



4. What is wrong with the following code and how would you fix it?

int n = 1;
if(n = 0)
{
	print("n is zero\n");
}


n is being set to 0 instead of testing to see if n is equal to 0.  Making the
if statement if(n == 0) would fix that.  print should also be printf.



5. What is wrong with the following code and how would you fix it?

int*ptr = nullptr;
scanf("%d", ptr);
printf("You entered %d",*ptr);


	ptr is a pointer that references no actual place in memory, the program then
attempts to dereference nullptr which is guaranteed Seg Fault.  We could declare
an int and then set ptr = to &saidInt.


6. What is the difference between the * and & operators?
		The & operator will return the memory address associated with the variable
	that follows the operator.  The * operator dereferences a pointer and returns
	the data stored in the address of said pointer.

7. Describe what each of the following declare:
	(a) int* a;  Declares a pointer to an int called a
	(b) const int b; Declares a constant integer called b
	(c) const int* c;  Declares a pointer to a constant int called c
	(d) int* const d;  Declares a constant pointer to an int called d
	(e) const int* const e; Declares a constant pointer to a constant int called e
